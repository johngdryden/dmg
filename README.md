Hi my Name is John, and I am passionate about cybersecurity. 
I am keeping my coding subjects for my Master of Cybersecurity here on github, and have been struggling with the coding and scripting exercises.
I am studying as much as I can in my spare time outside of working hours to better educate myself on the trials and tribulations that we face everyday in cybersecurity.
Cheers
